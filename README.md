# 🧠 ClassiFyAI Lite

ClassiFyAI Lite is a lightweight image classification app built with a graphical user interface (GUI). It uses a pre-trained deep learning model (Keras/TensorFlow) to identify objects in images from the CIFAR-10 dataset — including airplanes, automobiles, cats, dogs, ships, and more.

<br/>

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Simple and responsive GUI built using [Taipy](https://www.taipy.io/)
- 🖼️ Supports image upload and preview
- 🧠 Integrates with a trained TensorFlow/Keras model
- 🔍 Classifies images into 10 categories (CIFAR-10)
- 💡 Built for ease of use and quick predictions

## 📦 Requirements

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
